# Exploratory-Data-Analysis : Factors affecting Life Expectancy across continents

* Combined four datasets related to healthcare spending, GDP, and population across all continents from the Gapminder package in R.
* Pre-processed the merged data to get a total of 2585 data points in the final dataset.
* Performed data aggregation and visualization to discover relationships between average life expectancy by country and various explanatory variables for each continent using tidyverse library.
* Fitted linear regression model for predicting life expectancy using key variables such as GDP, per-capita healthcare spending, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, and continent.
* Collaborated and worked in a team to present the key findings.
